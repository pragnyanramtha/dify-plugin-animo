Privacy Policy for Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin
This Privacy Policy describes how the Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin ("the Plugin") operates and handles user information when integrated within the Dify platform and interacts with the Animo API. The Plugin itself is an intermediary tool and aims to minimize direct storage of your data.

1. Introduction
The Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin is designed to facilitate the creation of videos by sending user-provided prompts and parameters to a third-party service, the Animo API. The Plugin operates within the Dify AI application development platform.

2. Data Collection and Processing
The Plugin processes data as follows:

Input Data (User Prompts and Parameters): When you use the Plugin, your input (such as text prompts, desired video duration, style, and resolution) is temporarily processed by the Plugin. This data is immediately transmitted to the Animo API for video generation. The Plugin does not store these specific inputs after the request is sent to the Animo API.

Video Output Data: The video generated by the Animo API is streamed back to the Plugin as raw binary data. The Plugin then immediately transfers this binary data to the Dify platform using Dify's create_blob_message function. The Plugin itself does not persistently store the generated video files.

API Keys/Credentials: The Animo API Key and Endpoint URL are securely stored within the Dify platform's credential management system. The Plugin accesses these credentials at runtime to authenticate requests to the Animo API but does not expose or store them in its own code or logs.

3. How We Use Your Data
The data processed by the Plugin (your prompts and parameters) is used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your request to generate a video via the Animo API. The resulting video is then passed back to the Dify platform for display or further processing within your Dify application.

4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services
Animo API: All user inputs (prompts, duration, style, resolution) are shared with the Animo API. The Animo API is a third-party service, and its data handling practices are governed by its own privacy policy. You should review the Animo API's privacy policy to understand how they collect, use, and protect your data.

Dify Platform: The generated video output and any messages (e.g., success/error messages) are returned to the Dify platform. Dify's data handling and storage practices for application data and tool outputs are governed by Dify's own privacy policy and terms of service.

No Other Third Parties: The Plugin does not intentionally share your data with any other third parties beyond the Animo API and the Dify platform.

5. Data Security
The Plugin is designed to be a lightweight intermediary. It does not implement its own robust data storage or security measures beyond leveraging the security features provided by the Dify platform and the underlying Python environment. Data transmitted to the Animo API is typically done over secure HTTPS connections.

6. Your Rights
Your rights regarding the data processed by this Plugin are primarily dependent on the Dify platform and the Animo API's privacy policies. These typically include rights to access, rectify, erase, or restrict the processing of your personal data. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

8. Contact Us
