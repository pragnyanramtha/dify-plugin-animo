Comprehensive Guide for Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin, explaining its purpose, how to configure it, and how to effectively use it within your Dify applications.

1. What is the Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin?
The Animo Video Generator Dify Plugin is a powerful tool designed to integrate the video generation capabilities of the Animo API directly into your Dify applications (Chatflows, Workflows, or Agents). Instead of manually interacting with the Animo API, this plugin allows you to trigger video creation using natural language prompts or structured parameters within your Dify workflows.

The core function of this plugin is to:

Receive user input (a text prompt describing the desired video, along with optional parameters like duration, style, and resolution).

Send this input to your configured Animo API endpoint.

Receive the generated MP4 video file from the Animo API.

Return the MP4 video as a downloadable and playable file within the Dify interface.

2. Plugin Setup and Configuration
Before using the plugin, you need to ensure it's properly configured within your Dify instance.

2.1. Installation
If you obtained this plugin from the Dify Marketplace, installation is usually a straightforward click. If you are developing it locally, you'll need to follow Dify's plugin development and deployment guide to get it running.

2.2. Credentials Configuration
The plugin requires access to your Animo API. This is done by setting up credentials within Dify:

Animo API Key (animo_api_key): Obtain your API key from your Animo API provider. This key authenticates your requests.

Animo API Video Generation Endpoint URL (animo_api_endpoint): This is the specific URL of the Animo API that accepts requests for video generation. You will need to get this from the Animo API documentation.

Steps to Configure Credentials in Dify:

Navigate to your Dify application.

Go to the "Plugins" or "Tools" section where this plugin is listed.

Locate the "Credentials" or "Settings" area for the "Animo Video Generator" plugin.

Enter your animo_api_key and animo_api_endpoint in the respective fields.

Save the configurations.

3. Using the Animo Video Generator Tool
Once configured, you can invoke the Animo Video Generator tool in your Dify applications.

3.1. Tool Parameters
The AnimoVideoGeneratorTool accepts the following parameters:

prompt (string, required):

Description: The most important parameter. This is a creative and detailed text description of the video you want to generate.

Example: "A futuristic city at sunset with flying cars and towering skyscrapers.", "A whimsical animated short of a cat chasing a laser pointer through a magical forest."

duration (integer, optional):

Description: The desired length of the video in seconds. The Animo API might have minimum/maximum limits.

Default: 10 seconds.

Example: 20

style (string, optional):

Description: The artistic or visual style you want the video to have.

Options: cinematic (default), anime, realistic, cartoon, abstract, or any other styles supported by the Animo API.

Example: "anime"

resolution (string, optional):

Description: The desired resolution of the output video.

Options: 1920x1080 (Full HD), 1280x720 (HD, default), 720x480 (SD), or other resolutions supported by the Animo API.

Example: "1920x1080"

3.2. Invoking the Tool in Dify
In a Dify Chatflow or Workflow, you would add a "Tool" node and select the "Animo Video Generator" plugin. You would then map your application's input variables (or directly provide values) to the tool's parameters.

Example in a Chatflow/Agent:

A user might type:
"Generate a realistic video of a tranquil beach at sunrise, 30 seconds long."

Your Dify Agent's prompt engineering would then extract:

prompt: "a tranquil beach at sunrise"

duration: 30

style: "realistic"

And pass these to the AnimoVideoGeneratorTool.

Example in a Workflow:

You could have a "Text Input" node for the prompt, a "Number Input" for duration, and "Select" nodes for style and resolution, all feeding into the "Animo Video Generator" tool node.

4. Understanding the Output
When the AnimoVideoGeneratorTool successfully executes, it returns an MP4 video file to the Dify platform.

In Dify Chat/Agent Interface: The generated video will typically be displayed directly in the chat conversation, often with a playable embed or a download link for the MP4 file. You might also see a text message confirming the video generation.

In Dify Workflow: The output of the "Animo Video Generator" tool node will include a files variable (an array) containing details about the generated video, including a URL (url), MIME type (video/mp4), filename, and description. You can then use subsequent workflow nodes to utilize or display this video.

5. Use Cases
Automated Content Creation: Generate short promotional videos, social media clips, or explainer videos based on text descriptions.

Personalized Video Messages: Create custom videos for users in a conversational application.

Creative Prototyping: Rapidly generate visual concepts for film, animation, or game development.

Dynamic Visualizations: Convert data or concepts into engaging video formats.

6. Troubleshooting
"Animo API key is not configured" / "Animo API endpoint is not configured": Double-check your plugin's credentials in Dify and ensure both animo_api_key and animo_api_endpoint are correctly set.

"Missing required parameter: 'prompt'": Ensure your Dify application is providing a value for the prompt parameter when invoking the tool.

"Error connecting to Animo API" / HTTP Errors (4xx/5xx):

Verify your animo_api_endpoint URL is correct and accessible.

Check your Animo API key for validity.

Inspect the Animo API's documentation for rate limits or specific error codes.

The Animo API might be temporarily down or experiencing issues.

"Animo API did not return an MP4 video": The Animo API might have returned an unexpected format or an error message. Review the Animo API's documentation regarding its video output format and error responses.

Long Processing Times: Video generation can take time. Ensure your Dify application or workflow is configured to handle potentially long response times from external tools.

7. Further Development (for Plugin Developers)
Asynchronous Processing: For very long video generations, consider implementing asynchronous calls with webhooks if your Animo API supports it, to avoid Dify timeouts.

More Parameter Control: Add more parameters to the tool definition to expose additional Animo API features (e.g., specific aspect ratios, quality settings, background music options).

Error Handling Refinement: Implement more granular error handling based on specific error codes or messages from the Animo API.

Output Feedback: Provide more specific feedback to the user on the video generation process (e.g., "Video is being processed, please wait...").
